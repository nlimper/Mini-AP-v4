Welcome to the Mini AP v4 page.

You will find all documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/nlimper/Mini-AP-v4/wiki).

For tips, documentation, and contributions to the software, go to the [OpenEpaperLink github repo](https://github.com/OpenEPaperLink/OpenEPaperLink)

This hardware is not open source. You can order it on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/electronics-by-nic/) although it's currently out of stock and I don't have short term plans to order a new batch.
